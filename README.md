# Panda Party Playlist
â€‹
This project was completed as a final capstone project at Tech Elevator.  I collaborated with two other classmates to develop this project using Java Springboot backend with HTML/CSS/Javascript/Vue for the frontend.

It connects with Spotify API to search songs to add to events and playlist.
